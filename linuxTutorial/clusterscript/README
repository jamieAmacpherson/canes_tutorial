# Submit an MPI job, which runs on several cores in parallel.
# The program simulates a match score of all pairs among 6 items (for example sequences),
#  where the score is assumed to be the sum of the items' IDs:
# 0+1 = 1; 0+2 = 2; ...; 5+3=8; 5+4=9
# The 6*5/2=15 pairwise matches are split between the number of assigned cores.
# You will see the output of the local calculations and the global assembled array of results.
./submit_mpidemo.bash
# stdout and stderr are assigned to designated files.
